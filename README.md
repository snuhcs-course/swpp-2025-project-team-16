## Features

- **Baseline Camera Measurement for Instant Personalization**
Right after sign-up, users complete a simple squat measurement that evaluates their initial fitness level and generates a personalized starting routine.

- **Adaptive Workout Roadmap Tailored to Each User**
The main screen provides a clear, day-by-day schedule so users always know exactly what to do—and can begin training immediately.

- **Guided Training Session with Countdown Lock-In**
After pressing “Begin Training,” a 10-second countdown activates a temporary screen lock, ensuring full focus and preventing interruptions during the session.

- **Pose Analysis & AI Coaching**
Tracks posture, counts repetitions, and calculates XP automatically during training, with optional post-session pose evaluation for detailed AI feedback.

- **Progress Tracking & Gamified Rewards**
Levels, ranks, total workout time, and visual history help users see their growth, while XP and achievements keep them motivated to stay consistent.

- **Community Rankings for Extra Motivation**
A global leaderboard lets users compare performance, fostering friendly competition and amplifying long-term engagement.

## Target Customers

- Amateur athletes and sports enthusiasts who want structured training without hiring an expensive coach.  
- Beginners who want to learn sports safely with proper posture guidance.  
- Individuals seeking motivation and personalized support to sustain consistent exercise habits.  

## Motivation

- **Problem**: Many people begin exercising with strong initial motivation but quickly lose momentum. Without personal guidance—especially outside gym environments—beginners struggle with correct form, appropriate intensity, and knowing how to start. This lack of structure creates high entry barriers and leads to the common “three-day resolution” drop-off.

- **New Feature in Market**: Our system captures this early motivation by having users perform simple baseline exercises through an intuitive camera interface. Using AI-based posture recognition, the app provides beginner-friendly feedback, adaptive workout schedules, and personalized plans from the very first session—features rarely offered together in existing sports applications.

- **Why Important & Exciting**: By combining early commitment, real-time guidance, and gamified progression (XP, levels, rankings), FitQuest transforms short-term enthusiasm into long-term exercise habits. This approach makes training accessible, motivating, and socially engaging, helping users stay consistent, confident, and connected.
