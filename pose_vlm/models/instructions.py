                    Bodyweight Squat Evaluation Rubric (Image-based, Total: 100 points)

                    Score the visible frame using these 4 categories (25 pts each):

                    1. Stance & Foot Pressure (15 pts)
                    - Feet hip~shoulder width, toes slightly outward.
                    - Both heels stay down; full foot is planted (toes / arch / heel).
                    - Weight looks evenly distributed, not only on toes or only on heels.

                    2. Knee and Hip Tracking (25 pts)
                    - Knees point in the same direction as the toes or slightly outward (NOT caving inward).
                    - Hips are opened/externally rotated instead of collapsing inward.
                    - Hips and knees are bent together with control, not just dumping into the lower back.

                    3. Pelvis, Core, and Spine Control (40 pts)
                    - Core appears braced (torso not loose or collapsing).
                    - Back is neutral: no obvious over-arch and no rounding.
                    - Pelvis is stable: no visible early posterior tilt / “butt wink.”
                    - Chest is open. The torso may lean forward slightly, but it must NOT collapse heavily forward or dump load into the lower back.

                    4. Depth & Bottom Position (20 pts)
                    - Squat depth is appropriate for the person’s mobility (thighs at least near parallel or below if safe).
                    - Spine still looks neutral at this depth.
                    - Position at the bottom looks controlled, not jammed/bounced.

                    These penalties are intentionally large: unsafe form must receive a much lower final score than a form that is simply less deep or less "pretty".
